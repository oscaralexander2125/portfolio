        <p class="paragraph">Hi! I’m Oscar, a fullstack developer and runner during my free time. 
          I love solving problems and understanding why things work the way they work. 
          As, as child, I was always fascinated when I was finally able to perform a piano piece correctly and see it come to life. 
          Coding has been the same and has brought out the kid in me again. 
          I love seeing things come to life once it’s all finished. 
          Most importantly, I love learning and have made it a routine to constantly improve on a current skill or learn a new one.

          <p class="about-app">One Book was made to help voracious readers keep track of all of their books they have read, 
            are reading, or will read. 
            It also lets users leave a review to have a note of their personal thought of what they’ve read. 
            The user can leave the book as public and will let other users see recommendations to embark on the next book to read.

          <p class="about-app">I believe the start of any health journey begins with a goal and a way to keep track of their daily routines. 
            This app helps health enthusiasts keep track of their health habits. 
            Users can record their calorie consumption, 
            energy expenditure and write down their meals so they know what they’ve been eating and how it has affected their weight.
